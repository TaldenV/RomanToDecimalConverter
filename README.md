# RomanToDecimalConverter

Converts Roman numerals to decimal

- I spent about 45 min - hour thinking about how to solve the problem
- I found that roman numerals are split into 1,5, and 10 for each multiple of 10 (e.g I,V,X = 1,5,10 and X,L,C = (1,5,10) * 10)
- Using the flowchart in the bottom left of my notes I was able to come up with a way to find the value for each multiple of 10
- This website – https://numeralsconverter.com/convert-number-to-numeral/ – only calculates decimals from 1-3999, so I only solved for that amount as well
- At 4 hours, I was unable to remove all the code bugs so I saved it where it was at
- I was really interested in the solution, so I spent another hour to remove all the bugs and also included my answer for that
- I was unable to get to finish writing a program that would go the other way, but I would probably do a similar process to do the inverse
